Happy Chinese New Year! 新年快乐! (Xin Nian Kuai Le)
 
 Chinese characters for month and date: month + 月(yue) + day + 日(ri). The month and date are numbers written as below.
 Time uses Arabic numerals except that the characters for o'clock (点 dian) and half past (点半 dian ban) are shown.
 Weekday at the bottom. In Chinese the days of the week are: "星期一 = xing qi yi = weekday 1 = Monday", "星期二 = xing qi er = weekday 2 = Tuesday"..... "星期六 = xing qi liu = weekday 6 = Saturday". Sunday is special (星期天 xing qi tian).
 
 The Zodiac animal for the Chinese Lunar Year is displayed as your year's mascot. Until Feb 8 2015 it is year of the goat, but soon the monkey will take over.
 My town is full of red lanterns hanging from trees for Chinese New Year and it looks beautiful, so there's a lantern in the watch face.
 
 Low battery: background turns orange.
 Background goes black and short vibration when phone disconnects.
 Flick your wrist: the character for luck (fu 福) flashes on (upside down as per tradition) to bring you good fortune in the new year. It totally works.
 
 Year of the Monkey will be added to your Timeline!!
 
 Enjoy. Any suggestions appreciated. I speak a bit of Mandarin but I'm not actually Chinese so hopefully I've not made mistakes or done something massively insensitive.
